    "Thanks to the rapid advances in sequencing technologies generating genome-wide sequence datasets for any species has become routine and there is great interest in learning about the demographic and selective past of populations from sequence variation. The coalescent gives an elegant mathematical description of the ancestry of a sample of sequences from a more or less idealized population and, given its focus on samples, has become the bread and butter of modern population genetics. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite the flood of sequence data and the plethora of coalescent-based inference tools now available, many analyses of genome wide variation remain superficial or entirely descriptive. Developing efficient inference methods has been difficult for two reasons. First, analytic results for models of population structure and/or history are often restricted to average coalescence times and small (often pairwise) samples. Even when it is possible to derive the full distribution of genealogies for realistic samples sizes and models, the results are cumbersome and generally rely on automation (Lohse 2016). Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, dealing with recombination has proven extremely challenging and we still lack a full analytic description of genetic drift and recombination even under the simplest null models (in the absence of demography and selection). Thus, inference methods that incorporate linkage information generally rely on drastic simplifying assumptions about recombination (cite SMC papers and Song).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the severe limitations of relating sequence variation to mechanistic models analytically, coalescent simulations have become an integral part of inference in a number of ways: First, comparisons between analytic results against simulations serve as an important sanity check for both. Second, while it is often possible to use analytic approaches to obtain unbiased point estimates of demographic parameters by ignoring linkage (cite dadi and ), quantifying the uncertainty and potential biases in such estimates requires simulating data with linkage to conduct parametric bootstrapping. Finally, a range of inference approaches that rely on coalescent simulations directly to approximate the likelihood or - in a Bayesian setting - the posterior, of parameters under arbitrarily complex models of demography: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) (cite DIYABC, msBayes) has evolved ii) Approximate likelihood methods either based on SNPs (cite Excoffier) or blockwise data (cite ABLE). \n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of the user, inference tools are generally implemented with a command line or graphical user interface and are designed for a more or less narrow set of inference problems. Moreover, curent inference methods are based on a variety of coalescent simulators which are often. The aim of this chapter is to illustrate that how msprime (and its API) provides a flexible way to run and use coalescent simulations under under any model. We first explain the basic datastruture and methods msprimes for coalescent simulations and then show by the way of a set of simple practical examples how msprime can be used to obtain predictions for commonly used data summaries and diffferent models of demography. Finally, we show how msprime can be used to set up a ABC inference."

These trees represent the simulated history of a sample of individuals drawn from an idealised population (in later sections we show how to vary the properites of this idealised population). The function ``msprime.simulate`` runs these simulations, and the parameters that we provide to this function determine the exact simulation that we run. It returns a ``TreeSequence`` object, which represents the full simulated history of the sample. In later sections we discuss the effects of recombination, when this ``TreeSequence`` contains a list of correlated trees. For now, we assume that there is no recombinations, and we use the method ``first()`` to obtain the tree object from this tree sequence.

    "In this example we have two mutations, shown by the red squares. Mutations occur above a given node in the tree, and all samples beneath this node will inherit the mutation. The infinite sites mutations used here are simple binary mutations, so that the ancestral state is 0 and the derived state is 1. One convenient way to access the resulting sample genotypes is to use the ``genotype_matrix()`` method, which returns an $m \\times n$ numpy array, if we have $m$ variable sites and $n$ samples. Thus, if $G$ is the genotype matrix, $G[j, k]$ is the state of the $k$th sample at the $j$th site. In our example above, the site 0 has a mutation over node 3, and site 1 has a mutation over node 1, and so we get the following matrix:"

    "We create our population model by first making a list of two ``PopulationConfiguration`` objects. For convenience here, we use the ``sample_size`` argument to these objects to state that we wish to have two samples from each population. This results in samples being allocated sequentially to the populations when ``simulate`` is called: 0 and 1 are placed in population 0, and samples 2 and 3 are place in population 1. We then declare our migration matrix, which is asymmetric in this example. Because ``M[0,1] = 0.1`` and ``M[0,1] = 0``, forwards in time, individuals can migrate from population 1 to population 0 but not vice-versa. This is shown in the tree for this simulation, where each node has been coloured by its population (red is population 0 and blue population 1). Thus, the leaf nodes 0 and 1 are both from population 0, and 2 and 3 are both from population 2 (as explained above). As we go up the tree, the first event that occurs is 2 and 3 coalescing in population 1, creating node 4. After this, 4 coalesces with with node 0, which has at some point before this migrated into deme 1, creating node 5. Node 1 also migrates into deme 1, where it coalesces with 5. Because migration is asymmetric here, the most recent common ancestor of the four samples *must* occur within deme 1.\n",

From the present until 100 generations ago, we see that the population size is constant at 20,000. Then, we have a demographic event that changes the growth rate to 0.0035, which applies over the next epoch (from 100 to 750 generations ago). Over this time, the population grows from 2000 to 20,000, as we specified (note that the \"start\" and \"end\" of each epoch is looking *backwards* in time, as we consider epochs starting from the present and moving backwards). At generation 750 another event occurs, setting the growth rate for the population to 0. Then, the population size is constant at 20,000 from generation 750 until the indefinite past.\n",
